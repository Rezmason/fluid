feeders should seed on direct contact
	first check the min distance, then the "lobe distance"
		maybe lobe distance can be simplified by modding theta by 3
Forager agitation ("checkAgitation")
	foragers squirt muck when their agitation is within a certain range
	foragers jump if they aren't fully agitated, and it hasn't been too soon after squirting muck
Muck spread ("nextspread")
	slows when muck count > 5
game states ("gamestate")
	start, birth, growth, maturity
	affects muck spread ("spreadmuck")
