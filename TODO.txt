metaballs smin
Keep muck from overlapping neighboring algae
	another metaballs layer?
		+: might look good, why should feeders have all the fun
		-: might be too much of a departure from the original look
		+: the circular discs look a little dated anyway
		-: might negatively impact performance

	Things that would work without metaballs (choose one):
		Make every art an SVG tag?
			+: HTML stacking orders, already exist, maybe wrap them in more usable setup
				handle z-index internally
			-: Moves scene math out of SVG view box, etc
		Differentiate parent and transform basis
			+: no change to transform logic
			-: renderer has to "reparent" stuff
		Just do it manually
			+: this is how Flash folks would do it
			-: it wasn't fun then and it's not fun now

Move general stuff into lib folder for reuse in other projects
