Inspect performance

	localToGlobalMatrix could be cached

	How well does the vec lib perform?
		Any bottlenecks?
	Do breathing tweens leak memory?
Cache local-to-global matrix
Apply changes from decompilation insights
Make sure game DOM is truly self contained
	Metaball canvas got bumped by adding an absolute positioned element below the game tag
	The whole thing is actually pretty fragile
	itch.io just puts it in an iframe, that's probably the way to go
Feeders that can't combine should probably repel one another a bit
	Otherwise they wind up overlapping
	This includes all feeders at the beginning of the game
smin for metaball sums
Portrait orientation should swap width and height
pan audio based on global position
